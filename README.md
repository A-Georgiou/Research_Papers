### 2. **Evidence Reasoning is a Graph Problem**
**Description:**  
This paper redefines evidence reasoning as a graph-theoretic problem, offering a new perspective for improving the precision and explainability of inference processes. The novel approach leverages graph structures to represent relationships between evidence and claims.

**Highlights:**
- 🧠 **Graph Representation** of evidence-based reasoning, transforming reasoning steps into vertices and edges.
- 🔄 **Improved Explainability** through graph traversal algorithms that track how evidence supports or contradicts claims.
- 📊 **Application of Graph Theory** to enhance the accuracy of inference in decision-making systems.
- 🛠️ **Framework for Future Research** into graph-based approaches to complex reasoning tasks.

### 3. **Explaining and Editing Language Models for Fact-Checking**
**Description:**  
This was my masters thesis, which looked into how we can more efficiently update implicit knowledge stored within pre-trained language models
without doing computationally expensive and highly unstable fine-tuning through the use of a hyper-network. The research focused on the task of fact-checking, improving model performance at implicit claim verification, as well as producing
new techniques to generate explanations.
It offers a toolkit for understanding model decisions and provides methods to correct outputs when they deviate from factual information.


**Highlights:**
- 🛠️ **Toolset for Explaining Decisions** made by large language models in fact-checking scenarios.
- 📝 **Model Editing Techniques** that allow fine-tuning or correcting predictions in real-time without extensive retraining.
- 🚨 **Addressing Misinformation** by enabling fact-checkers to directly intervene in model outputs.
- 📚 **Case Studies** demonstrating the effectiveness of these methods in reducing false information propagation.

### 4. **How Important is Contextual Understanding in Spam Filtering**
**Description:**  
This study explores the significance of contextual understanding in detecting spam, revealing that context-aware models outperform traditional keyword-based techniques in distinguishing legitimate messages from spam.

**Highlights:**
- 💡 **Contextual Models** outperform simple keyword-based filtering approaches.
- 🧪 **Experimental Comparison** of deep learning models that leverage context versus traditional methods.
- 📉 **Reduction in False Positives** by using models that understand the broader message context, not just individual words.
- 📊 **Data Analysis** on real-world spam datasets, including insights on phishing detection.
